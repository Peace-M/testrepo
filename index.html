            Oh God of all creation
            Bless this our land and nation
            Justice be our shield and defender
            May we dwell in unity
            Peace and liberty
            Plenty be found within our borders.

            Let one and all arise
            With hearts both strong and true
            Service be our earnest endeavour
            And our homeland of Kenya
            Heritage of splendour
            Firm may we stand to defend

            Build this our nation together
            And the glory of Kenya
            The fruit of our labor
            Fill every heart with thanksgiving.
